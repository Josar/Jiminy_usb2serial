USe DFU from Atmel studio or FLIP to program the MCU

.\Jiminy_usb2serial\Jiminy_usb2serial\Debug\Jiminy_usb2serial.hex

flash USB 2 UART Bridge to atmega16u2

unplug replug device or reset it.

If lockbits are as follows then the device can be flashced with AS7 DFU or FLIP

LB = PROG_VER_DISABLED
BLB0 = NO_LOCK
BLB1 = SPM_DISABLE

LOCKBIT = 0xEC (valid)

If they are set as follows it is not possible, the chip has to be reset and then flashed with ISP.
The DFU is then lost. this seems to be an production error.

LB = PROG_VER_DISABLED
BLB0 = LPM_SPM_DISABLE
BLB1 = LPM_SPM_DISABLE

LOCKBIT = 0xC0 (valid)

When usb2serial bridge is flashed set fuses and lockbits as follows

BODLEVEL = 3V0
HWBE = [X]
DWEN = [ ]
RSTDISBL = [ ]
SPIEN = [X]
WDTON = [ ]
EESAVE = [ ]
BOOTSZ = 2048W_1800
BOOTRST = [ ]
CKDIV8 = [ ]
CKOUT = [ ]
SUT_CKSEL = EXTXOSC_8MHZ_XX_258CK_65MS

EXTENDED = 0xF4 (valid)
HIGH = 0xD9 (valid)
LOW = 0xDE (valid)

LB = PROG_VER_DISABLED
BLB0 = LPM_SPM_DISABLE
BLB1 = LPM_SPM_DISABLE

LOCKBIT = 0xC0 (valid)
